# Spravka

This is the Adobe Audition session project for the spravka mixdown.

This 1-minute track was used as a background instrumental at least 348 times in NNF during its spravka segments. This repository contains all of the spravka clips extracted from across over 100 NNF episodes along with the Audition file (spravka.sesx) where the segments with minimal voiceover were chosen and mixed together in an attempt to restore the background instrumental:
